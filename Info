Wind tunnel flows measurement and quantification using Hot Wire Anemometry (HWA) and Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). Experimental data set processed on MATLAB. HWA is a flow measurement technique that uses a heated wire probe that is introduced into the flow. The wire subject to the flow is then cooled, the corresponding voltage necessary to maintain the temperature of the flow can be used to quantify the flow velocity. On the other hand, PIV is an imaging based technique where a small section of the flow is illuminated using lasers. A high-speed camera then captures successive images of the flow, which can then be used to find average displacement using cross-correlation. Using the pulse width separation of the laser and average displacement using cross-correlation, the flow contours can be reconstructed using interrogation windows.
